Hi I'm Brett founder of Troglodyte Technologies, Inc. and Afterlife (TM). 
I am launching Afterlife (TM) in September 2022 God willing! It's a SaaS Multitenant Blockchain Hybrid which uses the cloud for the bones and Polygon BC for the Data Storage flesh of the prerecorded messages my clients leave their loved ones prerecorded before they died for afterlife for the benefit of their loved ones. 
I am really interested in finding a Head of Marketing, Sales, & BD for equity (up to 5%) and a 6FS. Afterlife (TM) is an unicorn 🦄 mathematicially unless I screw it up and fail to launch 🚀 it and scale it correctly. However, I have a vision and like the Blues Brothers am on A MFG so what or who can stand in the way of Lord of Hosts.
I am really interested in blockchain, cryptocurrency, NFTs, securities markets, commodities markets, and how the common Troglodytes are going to be able to live well in the brave new world and helping them find the light of life by sharing my experience strength and hope with anyone intrested to enable them to thrive financially in the world where people are living the NM of the Matrixfor real!
I am really interested in collaborating with people who care about others as well as themselves and understand what enlightened self interest is all about as explained in the movie entitled A Beautiful Mind based upon John Nash and his understanding of game theory.
Afterlife (TM) if it survives my ineptitude should have a 1B MC within year one of launching and I plan on devoting up to 70% of its profits to fund 7 NFPs which I plan on establishing...
1) A NFP to save the environment and stop global warming, 2) A NFP to fight for Racial Equality in America and the world and get reparations for all AA, 3) A NFP fighting for equality between genders, 4) A NFP fighting for equality among LBGQ and trans and everyone else,
5) A NFP fighting for the rights of endangered animals, cats, and dogs, 6) A NFP fighting for those who are in sexual slavery bondage because of human trafficking worldwide, especially teenagers, and
7) A NFP devoted to a GIS Mission of a search engine which allows you to enter the name and date of death and location of a loved one and be able to give you a map from wherever you are in the world to where your loved ones are resting eternally.
